# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (ML Project) – *In Progress*

This project applies basic **machine learning classification** techniques to the famous **Iris dataset** to predict the species of iris flowers based on petal and sepal dimensions. Built using Python and scikit-learn, it demonstrates beginner-friendly ML concepts such as data preprocessing, visualization, training, and model evaluation.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a supervised ML model that classifies an iris flower into one of three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** — using features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

## 🔍 Dataset Used

- 📊 **Iris Dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- 150 rows, 4 numeric features, 3 classes
- Built-in with `sklearn.datasets`

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` – data handling
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – model building and evaluation

---

## 🧠 ML Concepts Applied

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization using pair plots and histograms  
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree (optional extension)
- Accuracy score & confusion matrix

---

## 📸 Planned Visualizations

> *(Coming soon after project completion)*

- Pairplots by species
- Heatmap of correlation
- Confusion matrix of model performance
