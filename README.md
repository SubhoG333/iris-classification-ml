# iris-classification-ml
This project applies basic machine learning classification techniques to the famous Iris dataset to predict the species of iris flowers based on petal and sepal dimensions. Built using Python and scikit-learn, it demonstrates beginner-friendly ML concepts such as data preprocessing, visualization, training, and model evaluation.
